                            *Goal: Mini Fire Emblem* 
Focus RN:Weapons (Rock paper scissors)
                            ~Weapon Triangle~
    Sword(&Magic) /axe(bow) /lance(random) BUT lance/sword(magic)

~Evantually, make everything automated and clean~
    --Characters and weapons (Character class and weapon attr)
    
                            ~Battle Process~ 

1) Characters chosen at random
2) Winner/Loser chosen based on weapon type (print message)
3* Eventually add critical points, health, block attacks, healing (Healers)
4* Make character turn sequence (ðŸ‘€) (Ike -> Marth -> Roy)  
    ex = characters have their weapons. players for the rounds are 
        chosen. characters fight


Later: Make it a bit more like FE. How tho--TBD
RN tho (Ref zoo hw and make these interactions CLEANER B/C YEEEEEUHCK)

character class (name, health, weapon)
characters class (keeps a record of characters, like animals in a zooo)
 - list with the names INSIDE the class 
 -make characters, them add them to the char list in the class
    - see if you can make a loop for the range of len(list) that pulls up 
    weapons.
