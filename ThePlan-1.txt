                            ~Battle Process~ 

1) Characters chosen at random
2) Winner/Loser chosen based on weapon type (print message)
3* Eventually add critical points, health, block attacks, healing (Healers), 
    luck. 
4* Make character turn sequence (ðŸ‘€) (Ike -> Marth -> Roy)  
    ex = characters have their weapons. players for the rounds are 
        chosen. characters fight


RN: (Ref zoo hw and make these interactions CLEANER B/C YEEEEEUHCK)

character class (name, health*(Later) weapon)
characters class (keeps a record of characters, like animals in a zooo)
 - list with the names INSIDE the class 
 -make characters, them add them to the char list in the class
    - see if you can make a loop for the range of len(list) that pulls up 
    weapons. 

Next: add teams, an "exit" or "quit" command in while loop, 
a welcome/start, health attribute to character class ,
Later: Make it a bit more like FE. How tho--TBD. Numbers with weapons 
in a dictionary (TBD) OR just make it based on the fight stats--> Name it "firefightlite" 
LOOK THE GAME THAT YOU MADE FALL SEMESTER
